# README #

This is the public Emplate iOS SDK. Use this SDK to interact with the Emplate Platform, and integrate Emplate into you new or existing apps for iOS.

# Install
You can install the Emplate SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods. If you're not familiar with CocoaPods, you should take a look at their "[Getting started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)". It's awesome!

## Install the pod
Simply install the Emplate SDK by adding this line to your Podfile:

`pod 'EmplateSDK'`

..and then install the pod by:

`pod install`

Remember to open the Xcode workspace and not the project file

## Including the SDK in your app
By adding the following line to your ViewController, you'll get access to the whole SDK

`#import 'EmplateSDK.h'`
