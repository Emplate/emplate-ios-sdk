# EmplateSDK

This is the public Emplate iOS SDK. Use this SDK to interact with the Emplate Platform, and integrate Emplate into you new or existing apps for iOS.

## How do I get going?
You can install the Emplate SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods.

### Install the pod
Simply install the Emplate SDK by adding this line to your Podfile:

`pod 'EmplateSDK'`

..and then install the pod by:

`pod install`

Remember to open the Xcode workspace and not the project file

### Including the SDK in your app
By adding the following line to your ViewController or AppDelegate, you'll get access to the whole SDK

`@import EmplateSDK;`

## I have more questions - where do I go?
