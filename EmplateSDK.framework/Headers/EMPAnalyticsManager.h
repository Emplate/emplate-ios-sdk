/**
 This is the EMPAnalyticsManager class. This class is used to track data about the user of the app.

 When the service is initialized the first time, the user (EMPGuest) will automatically get a new guestId from the Emplate API. This is only done one time, and the user will keep the same guestId. Every analytics entry in the Emplate API is related to the EMPGuest.

 To track which EMPPost objects the user is opening, you will have to use the startPostViewOfPost: and finishPostViewOfPost:. The service will automatically add the guestId, date/time to the EMPPostView, and send it to the Emplate API. *If you're using different EMPAudiences for the EMPPost objects, please use the startPostViewOfPost:audience: and finishPostViewOfPost:audience: to relate the PostViews to the audiences as well.*

 You will only need to handle the PostViews. BeaconViews are automatically created in the EMPBeaconManager when the phone is near beacons.

 If the phone is offline when creating PostViews or BeaconViews, they will be cached and resent when the internet connection is reestablished.

 *Use the sharedManager to perform the methods in this service.*
